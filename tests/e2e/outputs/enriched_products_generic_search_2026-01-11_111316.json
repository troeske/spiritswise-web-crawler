        "nose_description": "Apples, which are always front and centre for me, when nosing an Auchentoshan. But, on this dram, these apples seem decidedly more crisp and tart, more like a green Granny Smith than the usual sweet, ripe reds I tend to pick up from this distillery. Werther’s Original caramels, vanilla and cotton candy are also quite assertive. With time, more subtle aromas also join the party: malt, leather and a dry grassy note.",
        "palate_description": "Whoa! This whisky is much richer and more potent than the typical core expressions from Auchentoshan – I guess an extra 13-14% abv will help with that! The mouthfeel is much thicker and creamier, as well. Flavours of juicy fruits, particularly stone fruit preserves jump out at me, along with Cuban honey (if you’ve had it, you understand the difference), sweet malted grain and real black licorice flavour. There is herbal, citrusy note that arrives toward the end… not exactly understated but a bit more like a lime-basil than like the actual citrus fruit. Either way, the tang is a welcome counterpoint to the sweet flavours at the onset. There is a satisfying alcohol burn in this dram, which creates a tingling, effervescent finish of medium length, full with pineapple, more licorice and a hint of barrel wood… this may sound unusual, but the finish is a little reminiscent of drinking a nice Chardonnay.",

Sweet citrus, with lemon zest, demerara sugar and vanilla cream coated tinned peaches. There’s some polished mahogony, sheeps wool, licorice root and smoked, salty bacon.",
        "palate_description": "Sweet orange marmalade and honeyed vanilla sponge start off proceedings, before the peat quickly makes itself known and adds a nice savoury and smoky seasoning, with some bacon frazzles, and whispy bonfire smoke on a salty sea breeze. I then get raisins, bitter chocolate, gingery spice, slightly bitter oak, and a nutty creaminess. There is a lot more of the licorice from the nose, but this time it reminds me of black jack chew sweets. All the while, the savoury sea air and light smoke lingers. The sweet notes become a little too artificial sweetener as it develops, which feels like it is from the grain component – almost bubblegum.",
