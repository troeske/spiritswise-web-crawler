# Raw Idea: Web Crawler System Implementation

## Feature Description

Implement the Web Crawler system for the SpiritsWise platform based on the comprehensive specification already created.

## Context

- The AI Enhancement Service (Tasks 4-5) is complete
- The Web Crawler Spec v3 has been created at: C:\Users\tsroe\Documents_Local\Dev\Spiritswise\spiritswise-web-crawler\specs\web-crawler-spec-v3.md
- A new GitHub repo was just created: https://github.com/troeske/spiritswise-web-crawler
- The remaining tasks are: Task 7 (Whiskey Web Crawler), Task 8 (Port Wine Web Crawler), Task 9 (Testing & Documentation)

## Core Objectives

The spec is for implementing the web crawler system that will:

1. Build the world's most comprehensive whiskey and port wine database
2. Use Smart Access Layer (httpx → Playwright → ScrapingBee) for age gate handling
3. Implement Prestige-Led Discovery (hunt award winners from competitions)
4. Use Hub & Spoke Discovery (retailers to find producers)
5. Mitigate link rot with Wayback Machine archiving
6. Integrate with the existing AI Enhancement Service for extraction
